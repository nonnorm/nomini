# Contributing Guidelines
First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute to Nomini! Contributions are always appreciated, and they can range from spelling and grammar fixes to whole new features, or even just bug reporting.

All in all, this is a pretty small project, with loosely defined contributing guidelines. If you're editing the source of Nomini, that can be found in `nomini.js`. Otherwise, the website is in `www/`.

If you're proposing a major feature, please do it in Issues before opening a PR. This will give us time to review and consider it before any code needs to be written.

## AI Policy
I have nothing against the use of Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, etc.) to assist in open-source projects. However, there are some guidelines that I expect everyone (including maintainers) to abide by:
1. **Fully understand what the AI generates**
2. **Be able to defend your choices, even if they were AI generated**
3. **Review AI code critically to ensure it meets project standards**

TL;DR: AI is permitted for use in the writing of code and docs. Just please keep in mind that the term *AI slop* was coined for a reason.
